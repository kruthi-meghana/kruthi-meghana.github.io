I’m a software engineer with over 6 years of experience developing and supporting enterprise applications using C, C#, .NET, Python and SQL Server. My background spans enterprise software development in Hyderabad and graduate studies in the U.S., where I strengthened my expertise in distributed systems, algorithms, and system design. Highly skilled in coding and problem solving. I also share a high level passion to Deep Learning and Machine Learning. My projects across various categories are available [here](https://github.com/kruthi-meghana).

At Aeroseal, I focused on designing backend architectures and loosely coupled systems that reduced manual billing cycles by weeks and improved operational accuracy, while ensuring resilience in distributed environments. I prioritize clarity and structured planning, creating systems that welcome change while keeping the next priorities clear.

More recently, I stepped into entrepreneurship as the Founder of [Almune](www.myalmune.com), where I lead product strategy, operations, and execution. Building a company from the ground up has deepened my appreciation for designing processes and systems that are both scalable and adaptable.

Certified in Machine Learning - Andrew NG(Coursera), Deep Learning Specialization - Andrew NG(Coursera), Tabelau.

I enjoy playing cajon and travelling.
